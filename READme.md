This project provides a comprehensive tool for analyzing your WhatsApp chat data, offering insights into communication patterns, user behavior, and group dynamics using streamlit.

## Key Features:

- **Effortless Data Import**: Upload your exported WhatsApp chat file directly into the user-friendly interface.
- **In-depth User Analysis**: Gain insights into individual user activity, including message count, word usage, media shared, and links exchanged.
- **Visual Storytelling**: Explore interactive charts and graphs to visualize message trends over time, identify peak activity periods, and discover the most frequent words and emojis used.
- **Comparative Analysis (for Group Chats)**: Uncover user roles within the group by comparing message contributions, identify the most talkative members, and analyze overall group communication patterns.

## Benefits:

- **Understand Group Dynamics**: Gain valuable insights into how conversations flow within your groups, who are the key influencers, and how often communication takes place.
- **Identify Communication Trends**: Track message frequency over time and pinpoint periods of high activity, helping you understand engagement patterns.
- **Personalize Communication**: Analyze your own chat behavior and identify areas for improvement, such as increasing participation or using more emojis for a lighter tone.

## Getting Started:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python (version 3 recommended) and essential libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `Streamlit` installed.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Use Git to clone this project's repository to your local machine.
3. **Run the Script**: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute the main script (e.g., `python main.py`).
4. **Upload Your Chat**: The web app will launch in your browser. Click "Browse Files" and select your exported WhatsApp chat file.
5. **Explore the Analysis**: The app will automatically process your data and present various visualizations and insights. Analyze individual users or the entire group depending on your choice.
